To compile the test library:

	make -f makefile fc.so


To compile the C program testing that the test shared library "works as intended":

	make -f makefile tex


To execute the C test program:

	./tex

(It shouldn't find the library, because it is not in the usual library search path.
Now, type "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=." - while in the project directory, then try again.
This time, the program should work as intended, and display beautiful lines on stdout...)



Now, the XS part:

To create the xs directory tree, simply use:

	make -f makefile xsInit
